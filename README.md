### Import Notes

Imports will be done through the dedicated user account [jonahadkins_dare_import](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jonahadkins_dare_imports) and will be done through OSM Import Guidelines - [See Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dare_County_Building_Import)  

A workable building polygon file was created from provided building footprints and a parcel polygon shapefile. Attributes from the parcels including address and parcel use were transferred over to the building footprints.

Imported buildings have the following `building=` tags populated:

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
